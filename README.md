A machine learning project that predicts house prices using Linear Regression.

Data Prep: Automatically maps categorical text (e.g., MSZoning, Exterior1st) to integers.

Handling NaNs: Imputes missing values to ensure model compatibility.

Model: Built with scikit-learn using an 80/20 train-test split.

Goal: Predict SalePrice based on physical and zoning attributes.

Usage: Run the mapping loop on prediction_data before fitting the model.
